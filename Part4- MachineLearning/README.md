Welcome to my zero to hero repo part 4 where I have covered all concepts from scratch to advanced level for Machine Learning, follow the below order

The Machine Learning Process:

1. Data Pre-Processing<br> <br> 
    1.1 Import the Libraries<br> 
    1.2 Import the Dataset<br> 
    1.3 Take care of missing values<br> 
    1.4 Encode Categorical data - Independent and Dependent Variables<br> 
    1.5 Splitting the dataset into the Training and Test set<br> 
    1.6 Feature Scaling<br> <br> 

2. Modelling <br> 
3. Evaluation <br>
