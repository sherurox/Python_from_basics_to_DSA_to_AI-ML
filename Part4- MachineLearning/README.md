Welcome to my zero to hero repo part 4 where I have covered all concepts from scratch to advanced level for Machine Learning, follow the below order

The Machine Learning Process:

1. Data Pre-Processing
    1.1 Import the Libraries
    1.2 Import the Dataset
    1.3 Take care of missing values
    1.4 Encode Categorical data - Independent and Dependent Variables
    1.5 Splitting the dataset into the Training and Test set
    1.6 Feature Scaling

2. Modelling 
3. Evaluation
